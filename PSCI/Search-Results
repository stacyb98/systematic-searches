Rerun searches to update results and include dementia, multi-infarct in MEDLINE, Cochrane
Also use Scopus for a CT search, forward and/or backward for relevant articles

Ovid MEDLINE October 12 2022 | 2,677 results |  6 duplicates 
Scopus October 12 2022 | 5,690 results |   duplicates
Cochrane October 12 2022 | 276 results | 95 duplicates
Also, I did an additional search on NARIC to see if there was any literature we might be missing. The results mostly focus on functional outcomes and Activities of Daily Living so not relevant to the current review.
